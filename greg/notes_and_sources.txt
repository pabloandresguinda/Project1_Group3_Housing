pull census data from census bureau website with census API(population / income / city economic growth / unemployment rate / ...)
clean the census API data
outline specifically what we want to show in our final report (rent vs sales prices overtime, available houses over time, average income for an area ...)

added notes from slack. todo: scrub census data for income by zipcode and housing market by zipcode

ensure .env is working properly

construct correct API stuff

[4] The homeowner vacancy rate is the proportion of the homeowner inventory that is vacant \"for sale.\" It is computed by dividing the total number of vacant units \"for sale only\" by the sum of owner-occupied units, vacant units that are \"for sale only,\" and vacant units that have been sold but not yet occupied; and then multiplying by 100.<br/><br/>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5] The rental vacancy rate is the proportion of the rental inventory that is vacant \"for rent.\" It is computed by dividing the total number of vacant units \"for rent\" by the sum of the renter-occupied units, vacant units that are \"for rent,\" and vacant units that have been rented but not yet occupied; and then multiplying by 100.<br/><br/>
