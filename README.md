## Project Guidelines
The following project guidelines focus on teamwork, your project proposal, data sources, and data cleanup and analysis.

### Collaborating with Your Team
Remember that these projects are a group effort. The experience of close collaboration will create better project outcomes and help you in your future careers. Specifically, you’ll learn collaborative workflows that will enable you to approach and solve complex problems. Working in groups allows you to work smart and dream big. Take advantage!

### Project Proposal
Before you start writing any code, your group should outline the scope and purpose of your project. This will help provide direction and safeguard against scope creep (the tendency for projects to become more complex after work begins).

The proposal is essentially a brief summary of your interests and intent. Be sure to include the following details:

The kind of data you’d like to work with and the field you’re interested in (finance, healthcare surveys, etc.)

The questions you’ll ask of the data

Possible source for the data

Use the following example for guidance:

The aim of our project is to uncover patterns in credit card fraud. We’ll examine relationships between transaction types and location, purchase prices and times of day, purchase trends over the course of a year, and other related relationships derived from the data.

### Finding Data
Once your group has written a proposal, it’s time to start searching for data. We recommend the following curated sources of high-quality data:

data.world (https://www.data.world/)
Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/)
Data.gov (https://www.data.gov/)
Awesome Public Datasets (https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)
Public-APIs (https://github.com/n0shake/Public-APIs)
Awesome API (https://github.com/Kikobeats/awesome-api)
Medium API (https://benjamin-libor.medium.com/a-curated-collection-of-over-150-apis-to-build-great-products-fdcfa0f361bc))

IMPORTANT
Whenever you use a dataset or create a new dataset based on other sources (such as existing datasets or information scraped from websites), make sure to use the following guidelines:

Check for copyright protections, and make sure that the way you plan to use this dataset is within the bounds of fair use.

Document how you intend to use this dataset now and in the future. Find any licenses or terms of use associated with the dataset, and review them to confirm that your intended use is in compliance.

Investigate how the dataset was collected. Identify any indicators that the data was obtained from a source that the compilers were not authorized to access.

You’ll likely have to adjust your project plan as you explore the available data. That’s okay! This is all part of the process. Just make sure that everyone in the group is aligned on the project’s goals as you make changes.

Make sure that your datasets are not too large for your personal computer. Big datasets are difficult to manage locally, so consider using data subsets or different datasets altogether.

### Data Cleanup and Analysis
Now that you’ve picked your data, it’s time to tackle development and analysis. This is where the fun starts!

The analysis process can be broken into two broad phases: (1) exploration and cleanup, and (2) analysis.

As you’ve learned, you’ll need to explore, clean, and reformat your data before you can begin answering your research questions. We recommend keeping track of these exploration and cleanup steps in a dedicated Jupyter notebook to keep you organized and make it easier to present your work later.

After you’ve cleaned your data and are ready to start crunching numbers, you should track your work in a Jupyter notebook dedicated specifically to analysis. We recommend focusing your analysis on multiple techniques, such as aggregation, correlation, comparison, summary statistics, sentiment analysis, and time-series analysis. Don’t forget to include plots during both the exploration and analysis phases. Creating plots along the way can reveal insights and interesting trends in the data that you might not notice if you wait until you’re preparing for your presentation. Presentation requirements will be further explained in the next module.

### Presentation Requirements
This section lists the Project 1 presentation requirements. Each group will prepare a formal, 10-minute presentation that covers the following points.

An executive summary or overview of the project and project goals:

Explain how the project relates to the industry you selected.
An overview of the data collection, cleanup, and exploration processes:

Describe the source of your data and why you chose it for your project.

Describe the collection, exploration, and cleanup process.

The approach that your group took to achieve the project goals:

Include any relevant code or demonstrations of the application or analysis.

Discuss any unanticipated insights or problems that arose and how you resolved them.

The results/conclusions of the application or analysis:

Include relevant images or examples to support your work.

If the project goal was not achieved, discuss the issues and how you attempted to resolve them.

Next steps:
Briefly discuss potential next steps for the project.

### Presentation Day
It’s crucial that you find time to rehearse before presentation day.

On the day of your presentation, each member of your group is required to submit the URL of your GitHub repository for grading.

rental data in king_county_rental.csv from https://www.zillow.com/research/data/ Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI)
Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI): A smoothed measure of the typical observed market rate rent across a given region. ZORI is a repeat-rent index that is weighted to the rental housing stock to ensure representativeness across the entire market, not just those homes currently listed for-rent. The index is dollar-denominated by computing the mean of listed rents that fall into the 40th to 60th percentile range for all homes and apartments in a given region, which is weighted to reflect the rental housing stock.

Beginning in May 2020 with publication of April 2020 data, Zillow is releasing a new measure of rental appreciation. The Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI) measures changes in asking rents over time, controlling for changes in the quality of the available rental stock in ways that other measures of rental prices cannot. 

What’s available to rent at any given time can change rapidly, and measures of median or average prices across time may not reflect actual market-based movements in rent prices, but instead simply reflect the fact that certain unit types are available at different times. ZORI solves this challenge by calculating price differences for the same rental unit over time, then aggregating those differences across all properties repeatedly listed for rent on Zillow.  

Underlying the index is Zillow’s industry-leading database of rental properties. To ensure we are capturing the rental market as a whole, and not just those rentals posted to Zillow, we created weights for the index based on the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau.  Units that appear more frequently in the Zillow data hold less weight, and those that appear less frequently are more heavily weighted. 

Information on the age of a given rental building and the number of units it contains is obtained from the annual American Community Survey (ACS). Data on age of buildings — the decade the structure was built — goes back to1940; homes built prior to 1940 are grouped together. The number of units in the structure is simplified to three categories: single-unit (detached and attached), 2-4 units and 5+ units.

ZORI is currently calculated at the national, metropolitan, county, city and zip levels for all regions where sufficient data is available.
